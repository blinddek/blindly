# CANON-FINDINGS — what this project owes `dev-standards`

<!-- Kit row `canon-findings`, a TEMPLATE: yours after the copy, and never compared. Modelled on
     pleks's, which opened the first one on 2026-09-10 after a finding carried in a chat report went
     a session undelivered. -->

`dev-standards` is **read-only from this session** (`CLAUDE.md` §1), so anything owed to it is
written here, ready for an estate session to lift **verbatim**. Three things are owed to it, and
each has a section.

**This is an OUTBOX, not a register.** An item leaves when canon files it and drops to **Filed**
with the canon SHA that took it. An empty outbox is the healthy state.

⚠ **Never write "pending" anywhere canon will read.** `LESSONS.md`'s `Applied:` has exactly two
states — a date, or `n/a:` with a reason. A lesson you have not answered is not a value; it is an
open item in this project's queue, and it stays in the `--emit-open` list until it is answered.

## 1 · Findings about the method

A defect in canon — a playbook, a standard, a kit file, a check. The portability test decides
whether it belongs here or in this project's own scars: *would it still be true on a repo with a
different stack?*

```

## 2 · Lesson answers

From `node <canon>/tools/check-lessons.mjs --emit-open <project>`. Read the entry before answering.
A date is the day this project's tree came to carry the lesson, with the evidence that shows it; a
reasoned `n/a:` closes an item as surely as a date. "Not yet" is not an answer — leave the lesson
off this table and it stays open.

| Lesson | Answer — `YYYY-MM-DD` or `n/a: <reason>` | Evidence — SHA, path or command |
|---|---|---|

## 3 · Kit reports

Adoptions canon has to record in `kitAdopted`, and pins: a row deliberately behind canon, with the
row id, the version held, the reason, and a review date. A pin means *read and deliberately behind*,
never *exempt*, so the reason has to argue it.

*None.*

## Filed

A pointer, not a restatement — the canon entry is the record.
